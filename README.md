# to-do-app
First Vanilla JS app

This is my first Vanilla JS Application. It's a simple to-do list, where you input text and create tasks, that you can then delete or mark as done.

v1.0:
- Working script that adds new items to the list,
- Wotking script that clears all items from the list,
- Basic responsive css.
