# to-do-app
First Vanilla JS app

This is my first Vanilla JS Application. It's a simple to-do list, where you input text and create tasks, that you can then delete or mark as done.

v1.2
- Added animations when a new "li" element is added to the list.
- Added animation when a list item is marked as done.

v1.1
- Fixed a bug where clicking "itemDone" li items from top to bottom changes class back to "item", but clicking from bottom to top leaves "i" with check symbol.

v1.0:
- Working script that adds new items to the list with button click or "enter" keydown,
- Wotking script that clears all items from the list,
- Working script that changes class from "item" to "itemDone" and back on click,
- Working script that deletes item when "x" is clicked,
- Basic responsive css - Flexbox.

Known issues/bugs:
- clicking "itemDone" li items from top to bottom changes class back to "item", but clicking from bottom to top leaves <> with check symbol.
